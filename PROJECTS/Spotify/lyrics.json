How deep is your love?\nI really mean to learn\n'Cause we're livin' in a world of fools\nBreakin' us down\nWhen they all should let us be\nWe belong to you and me\n[Verse 2]\nI believe in you\nYou know the door to my very soul\nYou're the light in my deepest, darkest hour\nYou're my saviour when I fall[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd you may not think I care for you\nWhen you know down inside that I really do\nAnd it's me you need to show\nHow deep is your love?\n[Chorus]\nHow deep is your love? How deep is your love?\nI really mean to learn\n'Cause we're livin' in a world of fools\nBreakin' us down\nWhen they all should let us be\nWe belong to you and me\n[Bridge]\nNa-na-na-na-na\nNa-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na\nNa-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na-na\nNa-na-na, na-na-na-na\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd you come to me on a summer breeze\nKeep me warm in your love, then you softly leave\nAnd it's me you need to show\nHow deep is your love?[Chorus]\nHow deep is your love? How deep is your love?\nI really mean to learn (I really mean to learn)\n'Cause we're livin' in a world of fools\nBreakin' us down\nWhen they all should let us be\nWe belong to you and me\n(Na-na-na-na-na)\nHow deep is your love? How deep is your love?\nI really mean to learn\n'Cause we're livin' in a world of fools\nBreakin' us down\nWhen they all should let us be\nWe belong to you and me\n(Na-na-na-na-na)\nHow deep is your love? How deep is your love?\nI really mean to learn\n'Cause we're livin' in a world of fools\nBreakin' us down\nWhen they all should let us be\nWe belong to you and me"
