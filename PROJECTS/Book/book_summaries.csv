A Doctor in the House,Mahathir Mohamad,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10749266-a-doctor-in-the-house,"In his twenty-two years as Prime Minister of Malaysia Dr Mahathir Mohamad transformed his country from an agricultural backwater into an industrial powerhouse that would become the seventeenth-largest trading nation in the world.This remarkable achievement was not without controversy, and Dr Mahathir‚Äôs extraordinary vision and iron grip earned him both enemies as well as ardent admirers within and outside of Malaysia. He has been described‚Äîtypically and paradoxically‚Äîas a tyrannical dictator, a b√™te noir, as well as inspiring, courageous and an outspoken defender of the downtrodden, the Third World, and moderate Islam.At almost every turn Dr Mahathir rewrote the rules. This book reveals hitherto unknown aspects of this intensely private, but publicly bold, statesman. It provides a clear and compelling narrative of modern Malaysian political history as seen through the eyes of one its greatest shapers. It is neither apology nor defence, but a forceful, compelling and often exciting account of how Dr Mahathir achieved what he did in so short a time, and why.About AuthorTun Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamad ( born 10 July 1925) (Jawi:ŸÖÿ≠ÿ™Ÿäÿ± ÿ®ŸÜ ŸÖÿ≠ŸÖÿØ) was the fourth Prime Minister of Malaysia.

A Tear at the Edge of Creation,Marcelo Gleiser,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7527320-a-tear-at-the-edge-of-creation,"For millennia, shamans and philosophers, believers and nonbelievers, artists and scientists have tried to make sense of our existence by suggesting that everything is connected, that a mysterious Oneness binds us to everything else. People go to temples, churches, mosques, and synagogues to pray to their divine incarnation of Oneness. Following a surprisingly similar notion, scientists have long asserted that under Nature‚Äôs apparent complexity there is a simpler underlying reality. In its modern incarnation, this Theory of Everything would unite the physical laws governing very large bodies (Einstein‚Äôs theory of relativity) and those governing tiny ones (quantum mechanics) into a single framework. But despite the brave efforts of many powerful minds, the Theory of Everything remains elusive. It turns out that the universe is not elegant. It is gloriously messy.Overturning more than twenty-five centuries of scientific thought, award-winning physicist Marcelo Gleiser argues that this quest for a Theory of Everything is fundamentally misguided, and he explains the volcanic implications this ideological shift has for humankind. All the evidence points to a scenario in which everything emerges from fundamental imperfections, primordial asymmetries in matter and time, cataclysmic accidents in Earth‚Äôs early life, and duplication errors in the genetic code. Imbalance spurs creation. Without asymmetries and imperfections, the universe would be filled with nothing but smooth radiation.A Tear at the Edge of Creation calls for nothing less than a new ""humancentrism"" to reflect our position in the universal order. All life, but intelligent life in particular, is a rare and precious accident. Our presence here has no meaning outside of itself, but it does have meaning. The unplanned complexity of humankind is all the more beautiful for its improbability. It‚Äôs time for science to let go of the old aesthetic that labels perfection beautiful and holds that ""beauty is truth."" It‚Äôs time to look at the evidence without centuries of monotheistic baggage. In this lucid, down-to-earth narrative, Gleiser walks us through the basic and cutting-edge science that fueled his own transformation from unifier to doubter‚Äîa fascinating scientific quest that led him to a new understanding of what it is to be human."
A Universe from Nothing,Lawrence M. Krauss,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11337189-a-universe-from-nothing,"Bestselling author and acclaimed physicist Lawrence Krauss offers a paradigm-shifting view of how everything that exists came to be in the first place.‚ÄúWhere did the universe come from? What was there before it? What will the future bring? And finally, why is there something rather than nothing?‚ÄùOne of the few prominent scientists today to have crossed the chasm between science and popular culture, Krauss describes the staggeringly beautiful experimental observations and mind-bending new theories that demonstrate not only can something arise from nothing, something will always arise from nothing. With a new preface about the significance of the discovery of the Higgs particle, A Universe from Nothing uses Krauss‚Äôs characteristic wry humor and wonderfully clear explanations to take us back to the beginning of the beginning, presenting the most recent evidence for how our universe evolved‚Äîand the implications for how it‚Äôs going to end.Provocative, challenging, and delightfully readable, this is a game-changing look at the most basic underpinning of existence and a powerful antidote to outmoded philosophical, religious, and scientific thinking."

Agnosticism,Robin Le Poidevin,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8151688-agnosticism?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=AWgrMCtu1B&rank=1,"What is agnosticism? Is it a belief, or merely the absence of belief? Is it the result of too little thought about an issue--or too much? Who were the first to call themselves ""agnostics""? Does agnosticism deserve serious consideration today? Can an agnostic live a religious life? What place should agnosticism have in education? These are just some of the questions that Robin Le Poidevin considers in this Very Short Introduction , as he sets the philosophical case for agnosticism and explores it as a historical and cultural phenomenon. Agnosticism emerges here as a much more sophisticated, and much more interesting, attitude than a simple failure to either commit to, or reject, religious belief. Le Poidevin challenges the common wisdom about agnosticism among both believers and atheists, and invites the reader to rethink their own position on the issues. Indeed, in arguing in favor of agnosticism as a respectable position to take, this stimulating and provocative guide takes issueon many points with the assertions of prominent atheists such as Richard Dawkins."

Candide,Voltaire,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19380.Candide,"Candideis the story of a gentle man who, though pummeled and slapped in every direction by fate, clings desperately to the belief that he lives in ""the best of all possible worlds."" On the surface a witty, bantering tale, this eighteenth-century classic is actually a savage, satiric thrust at the philosophical optimism that proclaims that all disaster and human suffering is part of a benevolent cosmic plan. Fast, funny, often outrageous, the French philosopher's immortal narrative takes Candide around the world to discover that -- contrary to the teachings of his distinguished tutor Dr. Pangloss -- all is not always for the best.

Civilization and Its Discontents,Sigmund Freud,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/357636.Civilization_and_Its_Discontents,"It stands as a brilliant summary of the views on culture from a psychoanalytic perspective that he had been developing since the turn of the century. It is both witness and tribute to the late theory of mind‚Äîthe so-called structural theory, with its stress on aggression, indeed the death drive, as the pitiless adversary of eros.Civilization and Its Discontentsis one of the last of Freud's books, written in the decade before his death and first published in German in 1929. In it he states his views on the broad question of man's place in the world, a place Freud defines in terms of ceaseless conflict between the individual's quest for freedom and society's demand for conformity.Freud's theme is that what works for civilization doesn't necessarily work for man. Man, by nature aggressive and egotistical, seeks self-satisfaction. But culture inhibits his instinctual drives. The result is a pervasive and familiar guilt.Of the various English translations of Freud's major works to appear in his lifetime, only one was authorized by Freud himself:The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freudunder the general editorship of James Strachey.Freud approved the overall editorial plan, specific renderings of key words and phrases, and the addition of valuable notes, from bibliographical and explanatory. Many of the translations were done by Strachey himself; the rest were prepared under his supervision. The result was to place theStandard Editionin a position of unquestioned supremacy over all other existing versions."
Conversations on Consciousness,Susan Blackmore,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/254499.Conversations_on_Consciousness,"In Conversations on Consciousness, Susan Blackmore interviews some of the great minds of our time, a who's who of eminent thinkers, all of whom have devoted much of their lives to understanding the concept of consciousness.The interviewees, ranging from major philosophers to renowned scientists, talk candidly with Blackmore about some of the key philosophical issues confronting us in a series of conversations that are revealing, insightful, and stimulating.They ruminate on the nature of consciousness (is it something apart from the brain?) and discuss if it is even possible to understand the human mind. Some of these thinkers say no, but most believe that we will pierce the mystery surrounding consciousness, and that neuroscience will provide the key. Blackmore goes beyond the issue of consciousness to ask other intriguing questions: Is there free will? (A question which yields many conflicted replies, with most saying yes and no.) If not, how does this effect the way you live your life; and more broadly, how has your work changed the way you live?Paired with an introduction and extensive glossary that provide helpful background information, these provocative conversations illuminate how some of the greatest minds tackle some of the most difficult questions about human nature."
Crime and Punishment,Fyodor Dostoevsky,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7144.Crime_and_Punishment,"Raskolnikov, a destitute and desperate former student, wanders through the slums of St Petersburg and commits a random murder without remorse or regret. He imagines himself to be a great man, a Napoleon: acting for a higher purpose beyond conventional moral law. But as he embarks on a dangerous game of cat and mouse with a suspicious police investigator, Raskolnikov is pursued by the growing voice of his conscience and finds the noose of his own guilt tightening around his neck. Only Sonya, a downtrodden sex worker, can offer the chance of redemption."
Double Entry,Jane Gleeson-White,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13136518-double-entry?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_18,"Filled with colorful characters and history, Double Entry takes us from the ancient origins of accounting in Mesopotamia to the frontiers of modern finance. At the heart of the story is double-entry bookkeeping: the first system that allowed merchants to actually measure the worth of their businesses. Luca Pacioli‚Äïmonk, mathematician, alchemist, and friend of Leonardo da Vinci‚Äïincorporated Arabic mathematics to formulate a system that could work across all trades and nations. As Jane Gleeson-White reveals, double-entry accounting was nothing short of revolutionary: it fueled the Renaissance, enabled capitalism to flourish, and created the global economy. John Maynard Keynes would use it to calculate GDP, the measure of a nation‚Äôs wealth. Yet double-entry accounting has had its failures. With the costs of sudden corporate collapses such as Enron and Lehman Brothers, and its disregard of environmental and human costs, the time may have come to re-create it for the future."
Economics: The User's Guide,Ha-Joon Chang,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20613671-economics,"In his bestselling23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism, Cambridge economist Ha-Joon Chang brilliantly debunked many of the predominant myths of neoclassical economics. Now, in an entertaining and accessible primer, he explains how the global economy actually works‚Äîin real-world terms. Writing with irreverent wit, a deep knowledge of history, and a disregard for conventional economic pieties, Chang offers insights that will never be found in the textbooks.Unlike many economists, who present only one view of their discipline,¬†Chang introduces a wide range of economic theories, from classical to Keynesian, revealing how each has its strengths and weaknesses, and why¬† there is no one way to explain economic behavior. Instead, by ignoring the received wisdom and exposing the myriad forces that shape our financial world, Chang gives us the tools we need to understand our increasingly global and interconnected world often driven by economics. From the future of the Euro, inequality in China, or the condition of the American manufacturing industry here in the United States‚ÄîEconomics: The User‚Äôs Guideis a concise and expertly crafted guide to economic fundamentals that offers a clear and accurate picture of the global economy and how and why it affects our daily lives."
Educated,Tara Westover,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35133922-educated,"Tara Westover was 17 the first time she set foot in a classroom. Born to survivalists in the mountains of Idaho, she prepared for the end of the world by stockpiling home-canned peaches and sleeping with her ""head-for-the-hills bag"". In the summer she stewed herbs for her mother, a midwife and healer, and in the winter she salvaged in her father's junkyard.Her father forbade hospitals, so Tara never saw a doctor or nurse. Gashes and concussions, even burns from explosions, were all treated at home with herbalism. The family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education and no one to intervene when one of Tara's older brothers became violent.Then, lacking any formal education, Tara began to educate herself. She taught herself enough mathematics and grammar to be admitted to Brigham Young University, where she studied history, learning for the first time about important world events like the Holocaust and the civil rights movement. Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her over oceans and across continents, to Harvard and to Cambridge. Only then would she wonder if she'd traveled too far, if there was still a way home.Educatedis an account of the struggle for self-invention. It is a tale of fierce family loyalty and of the grief that comes with severing the closest of ties. With the acute insight that distinguishes all great writers, Westover has crafted a universal coming-of-age story that gets to the heart of what an education is and what it offers: the perspective to see one's life through new eyes and the will to change it."
Economix: How and Why Our Economy Works,Michael    Goodwin,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13591145-economix,"Stimulus plans: good or bad? Free markets: How free are they?

Read ""Economix.""With clear, witty writing and quirky, accessible art, this important and timely graphic novel transforms ""the dismal science"" of economics into a fun, fact-filled story about human nature and our attempts to make the most of what we've got . . . and sometimes what our neighbors have got. ""Economix ""explains it all, from the beginning of Western economic thought, to markets free and otherwise, to economic failures, successes, limitations, and future possibilities.

The bonus: Who would have guessed that economics could be fun, and--here's the joy--really accessible? Goodwin roots us in history and fills us with common sense understanding. As he puts it early on, economics seems horribly complicated mostly because we're looking at it all at once. Broken down into its component pieces, it's relatively easy to understand. And a good understanding of economics is critical to maneuvering in the world today. If I were compiling a list of the 100 most important books you can read in a lifetime, this would be on it.""--Stephen Petranek, editor-in-chief, Weider History magazines, former editor-in-chief of ""Discover"" magazine ""Through a potent mix of comics and punchy, concise, accessible prose, Goodwin takes us on a provocative, exhaustively researched, and exceedingly engaging trip through our history and present day, creating an alternately hilarious and scary picture of where we are today as an economy-- and what it all means. More than that, Goodwin makes the arcane, understandable. If your mind either spins or slumbers at the thought of economics, read Goodwin's ""Economix"" and all will become clear. --Nomi Prins, author of ""It Takes a Pillage: An Epic Tale of Power, Deceit, and Untold Trillions"" """"Economix"" is a lively, cheerfully opinionated romp through the historical and intellectual foundations of our current economy and our current economic problems.

Taking us on a trip which stops at different definitions of Event, ≈Ωi≈æek addresses fundamental questions such as: are all things connected? How much are we agents of our own fates? Which conditions must be met for us to perceive something as really existing? In a world that's constantly changing, is anything new really happening?

F**K It Therapy,John C. Parkin,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13587518-f-k-it-therapy,"If everyone learned to use this expression in the right, liberating, and non-aggressive way, there would probably be fewer doctors, fewer psychologists, and, why not?, the world would be better: less stress, less tension, more lightness, and more harmony. How many times have we unnecessarily wrapped our heads in worries, gotten lost in a glass of water, exaggerated trivial problems, or been assaulted by unfounded anxieties or fears? Too many times. Instead, we should learn to give the right weight to things. Those who have experienced dramatic events know this well: getting upset over the small ""troubles"" of everyday life makes no sense; it only poisons our lives. This is the liberating message that John Parkin and Gaia Pollini want to convey with their book, which, rich in suggestions, practical examples, and techniques to try immediately, will guide us on a new path to learn to appreciate life in every moment for what it is, not for how we wish it to be."
Free Will,Sam Harris,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13259270-free-will,"Belief in free will touches nearly everything that human beings value. It is difficult to think about law, politics, religion, public policy, intimate relationships, morality‚Äîas well as feelings of remorse or personal achievement‚Äîwithout first imagining that every person is the true source of his or her thoughts and actions. And yet the facts tell us that free will is an illusion.In this enlightening book, Sam Harris argues that this truth about the human mind does not undermine morality or diminish the importance of social and political freedom, but it can and should change the way we think about some of the most important questions in life."
Freud for Beginners,Richard Appignanesi,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85412.Freud_for_Beginners,"The Beginner Books -- ""Their cartoon format and irreverent wit make difficult ideas accessible and entertaining."" -- NewsdayEverything you need to know about neurosis, libido, ego, and id -- but somehow it slipped your mind.Freud for Beginners is a perfect introduction to the life and thought of the man whose discovery of psychoanalysis revolutionized our attitudes towards mental illness, religion, sex, and culture. This documentary cartoon book plunges us into the world of late-nineteenth-century Vienna in which Freud grew up. We explore his early background in science, his work as a therapist, his encounter with cocaine, and his theories on the unconscious, dreams, the Oedipus Complex, and sexuality.We meet his family, his friend and enemies, and his patients -- The Rat Man, Anna O., Little Hans -- and we get an insider's view as the psychoanalytic movement is launched. The zany art and probing text do an extraordinary job of simplifying Freud without trivializing him."
Freud Verbatim,Sigmund Freud,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20821440-freud-verbatim,"Sigmund Freud has inspired more fascination and controversy than any other intellectual in history. Despite the intense opposition he encountered during his life, this ‚Äúexplorer of the unconscious‚Äù exerted an irresistibly stimulating effect on contemporary thought. As the founder of psychoanalysis and the creator of such commonly used terms as ego, superego, and id, Freud has had an unrivaled impact on the modern world.Freud Verbatimis a collection of quotes, maxims, observations, and witticisms by Freud on subjects ranging from politics and religion to love and sex. In addition to assembling passages from Freud‚Äôs major works, this collection also makes use of personal letters to his friends and family.

Islam dalam Sejarah dan Kebudayaan Melayu,Syed Muhammad Naquib al-Attas,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9793290-islam-dalam-sejarah-dan-kebudayaan-melayu,"Voltaire once said that historical facts, which are fragmentary and do not lead to any objective, are to history what transport goods are to an armyómerely a burden of resistance; we must view history with a universal perspective, precisely because the human mind is so small that if it is burdened with those fragmentary facts, it will surely be oppressed.

Although the consideration of those minute facts shows and states things that truly occurred in history, if seen from the decorative viewpoint of the historical landscape, then those facts become false and are akin to an antinomy in the philosophy of history. We must regard such facts as words arranged in a dictionary; although each one of them clarifies the truth of its meaning, overall, it does not contain meaning because its arrangement is solely based on the sequence of letters in the alphabet, not on the interconnection of concepts and important words that can convey a depiction of the worldview of the community using that compiled language. Thus, it is similar to the metaphor used by Macaulay regarding the experiences of the traveler Gulliver in the land of Brobdingnag, inhabited by giant humans."

ìThe first man to throw words of insult at the enemy instead of a spear was the founder of civilization. Therefore, words are substitutes for acts, and in certain circumstances, the only substitutes.î ó Sigmund Freud

With his revolutionary ideas about the meaning of dreams, repression, the unconscious, and the clinical method of treatment through speech, Freud left a legacy of rich, detailed, and provocative psychology. Once absorbed, it has the ability to enhance our sensitivity to others and ourselves, deepen our creativity, and improve the fabric of our lives.

Organized by The School of Life, a center of knowledge and well-being founded in London by Alain de Botton, these books demonstrate how the voices of wisdom from other times have something inspiring for each of us.

Questioning the Veil: Open Letters to Muslim Women,Marnia Lazreg,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6833681-questioning-the-veil,"Why Muslim women should not wear the veilAcross much of the world today, Muslim women of all ages are increasingly choosing to wear the veil. Is this trend a sign of rising piety or a way of asserting Muslim pride? And does the veil really provide women freedom from sexual harassment? Written in the form of letters addressing all those interested in this issue, Questioning the Veil examines the inconsistent and inadequate reasons given for the veil, and points to the dangers and limitations of this highly questionable cultural practice. Marnia Lazreg, a preeminent authority in Middle East women's studies, combines her own experiences growing up in a Muslim family in Algeria with interviews and the real-life stories of other Muslim women to produce this nuanced argument for doing away with the veil.Lazreg stresses that the veil is not included in the five pillars of Islam, asks whether piety sufficiently justifies veiling, explores the adverse psychological effects of the practice on the wearer and those around her, and pays special attention to the negative impact of veiling for young girls. Lazreg's provocative findings indicate that far from being spontaneous, the trend toward wearing the veil has been driven by an organized and growing campaign that includes literature, DVDs, YouTube videos, and courses designed by some Muslim men to teach women about their presumed rights under the veil.An incisive mix of the personal and political, supported by meticulous research, Questioning the Veil will compel all readers to reconsider their views of this controversial and sensitive topic."

Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind,Yuval Noah Harari,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens,"From a renowned historian comes a groundbreaking narrative of humanity‚Äôs creation and evolution‚Äîa #1 international bestseller‚Äîthat explores the ways in which biology and history have defined us and enhanced our understanding of what it means to be ‚Äúhuman.‚Äù One hundred thousand years ago, at least six different species of humans inhabited Earth. Yet today there is only one‚Äîhomo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us? Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, Sapiens integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas. Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become? Featuring 27 photographs, 6 maps, and 25 illustrations/diagrams, this provocative and insightful work is sure to spark debate and is essential reading for aficionados of Jared Diamond, James Gleick, Matt Ridley, Robert Wright, and Sharon Moalem."

Supercooperators,M.A. Nowak,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11560474-supercooperators,"EVOLUTION IS OFTEN PRESENTED AS A STRICTLY COMPETITIVE ENDEAVOR. This point of view has had serious implications for the way we see the mechanics of both science and culture. But scientists have long wondered how societies could have evolved without some measure of cooperation. And if there was cooperation involved, how could it have arisen from nature ""red in tooth and claw""? Martin Nowak, one of the world's experts on evolution and game theory, working here with bestselling science writer Roger Highfield, turns an important aspect of evolutionary theory on its head to explain why cooperation, not competition, has always been the key to the evolution of complexity. He offers a new explanation for the origin of life and a new theory for the origins of language, biology's second greatest information revolution after the emergence of genes. ""SuperCooperators ""also brings to light his game-changing work on disease. Cancer is fundamentally a failure of the body's cells to cooperate, Nowak has discovered, but organs are cleverly designed to foster cooperation, and he explains how this new understanding can be used in novel cancer treatments.Nowak and Highfield examine the phenomena of reciprocity, reputation, and reward, explaining how selfless behavior arises naturally from competition; how forgiveness, generosity, and kindness have a mathematical rationale; how companies can be better designed to promote cooperation; and how there is remarkable overlap between the recipe for cooperation that arises from quantitative analysis and the codes of conduct seen in major religions, such as the Golden Rule.In his first book written for a wide audience, this hugely influential scientist explains his cutting-edge research into the mysteries of cooperation, from the rise of multicellular life to Good Samaritans. With wit and clarity, Nowak and Highfield make the case that cooperation, not competition, is the defining human trait. ""SuperCooperators ""will expand our understanding of evolution and provoke debate for years to come."

And yet, disturbingly, in today's so-called information age, pseudoscience is burgeoning with stories of alien abduction, channeling past lives, and communal hallucinations commanding growing attention and respect. As Sagan demonstrates with lucid eloquence, the siren song of unreason is not just a cultural wrong turn but a dangerous plunge into darkness that threatens our most basic freedoms."

He eviscerates the major arguments for religion, and demonstrates the supreme improbability of a supreme being. He shows how religion fuels war, foments bigotry, and abuses children, buttressing his points with historical and contemporary evidence.The God Delusionmakes a compelling case that belief in God is not just wrong, but potentially deadly. It also offers exhilarating insight into the advantages of atheism to the individual and society, not the least of which is a clearer, truer appreciation of the universe's wonders than any faith could ever muster."

The Museum of Scandals: Art that Shocked the World,Elea Baucheron,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17873059-the-museum-of-scandals,"Spanning the Renaissance to the 21st century, this riveting collection of scandalous works shows how the notion of ""shocking"" art has evolved and explores why and how artists continue to push the public‚Äôs visual buttons. For centuries artists have been pushing the limits of society‚Äôs norms, whether in the form of a new technique, subject matter, or message. In the 15th century, a fresco by Masaccio shocked audiences by playing with perspective to depict Adam and Eve‚Äôs expulsion from Eden. Some 500 years later, Diego Rivera featured Lenin at the center of Man at the Crossroads, commissioned by John D. Rockefeller Jr. for the lobby of New York's soon-to-be-completed Rockefeller Center; the mural was destroyed when it was deemed too radical to display. This fascinating volume presents dozens of paintings, prints, photographs, and installations that horrified audiences when they were created. Each example is presented in generous spreads with large color reproductions and an insightful text exploring the artist's intentions and the piece's historical context. Most of these works no longer have the power to shock us, but a number of them still do. Together they offer a thought-provoking exploration of the artist‚Äôs duty to instigate, inspire, and move audiences toward new ways of thinking."

Theology of Tariq Ramadan,Gregory Baum,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6484202-theology-of-tariq-ramadan,"Tariq Ramadan has emerged as one of the most influential Muslim theologians in the world today. In this important book, Gregory Baum presents for the first time an introduction to several key aspects of Ramadan's theological enterprise. Baum examines Ramadan's work historically within an interfaith perspective, drawing several parallels between Islamic and Catholic encounters with modernity. His comparison of the debates in the two traditions suggests that reform and renewal are compatible with the substance of both Catholic and Muslim traditions. After a brief account of the evolution of Catholic theology up to the Second Vatican Council, Baum introduces Ramadan's published work and theological orientation, examining both within the historical development of Islam. He outlines Ramadan's theology of God, humanity, and the universe and discusses Ramadan's interpretation of sharia , the divinely revealed Islamic way of life. The book then addresses what fidelity to Islam means for Western Muslims and contrasts Ramadan's theology with the theological liberalism advocated by some Muslim authors. Throughout, Baum makes helpful connections between Islam and Vatican II Catholicism. Both belief systems are steeped in ancient traditions, rely on a sacred book, and find themselves confronting a modern context. Reformist Islam shares much with Catholic social thought in showing a regard for the poor and marginalized. Baum concludes by examining points of difference between Muslim and Catholic theology that support further conversation. This readable introduction to Ramadan's work is accessible to non-Muslim students, teachers, clergy, and general readers interested in Islam and interfaith dialogue."

He is among the leading Islamic thinkers in the West, with a large following around the world. But he has also been a lightning rod for controversy. Indeed, in 2004, Ramadan was prevented from entering the U.S. by the Bush administration and despite two appeals, supported by organizations like the American Academy of Religion and the ACLU, he was barred from the country until spring of 2010, when Secretary of State Hillary Clinton finally lifted the ban.In What I Believe , Ramadan attempts to set the record straight, laying out the basic ideas he stands for in clear and accessible prose. He describes the book as a work of clarification, directed at ordinary citizens, politicians, journalists, and others who are curious (or skeptical) about his positions. Aware that that he is dealing with emotional issues, Ramadan tries to get past the barriers of prejudice and misunderstanding to speak directly, from the heart, to his Muslim and non-Muslim readers alike. In particular, he calls on Western Muslims to escape the mental, social, cultural, and religious ghettos they have created for themselves and become full partners in the democratic societies in which they live. At the same time, he calls for the rest of us to recognize our Muslim neighbors as citizens with rights and responsibilities the same as ours.

Coyne,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4005310-why-evolution-is-true,"Why evolution is more than just a theory: it is a fact.In all the current highly publicized debates about creationism and its descendant ""intelligent design,"" there is an element of the controversy that is rarely mentioned‚Äîthe ""evidence,"" the empirical truth of evolution by natural selection. Even Richard Dawkins and Stephen Jay Gould, while extolling the beauty of evolution and examining case studies, have not focused on the evidence itself. Yet the proof is vast, varied, and magnificent, drawn from many different fields of science. Scientists are observing species splitting into two and are finding more and more fossils capturing change in the past‚Äîdinosaurs that have sprouted feathers, fish that have grown limbs.Why Evolution Is Trueweaves together the many threads of modern work in genetics, paleontology, geology, molecular biology, and anatomy that demonstrate the ""indelible stamp"" of the processes first proposed by Darwin. In crisp, lucid prose accessible to a wide audience,Why Evolution Is Truedispels common misunderstandings and fears about evolution and clearly confirms that this amazing process of change has been firmly established as a scientific truth."
Why I am not a Christian,Bertrand Russell,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30045219-why-i-am-not-a-christian,"While its tone is playful and frivolous, this book poses tough questions over the nature of religion and belief.Religion provides comfortable responses to the questions that have always beset humankind - why are we here, what is the point of being alive, how ought we to behave? Russell snatches that comfort away, leaving us instead with other, more troublesome alternatives: responsibility, autonomy, self-awareness. He tells us that the time to live is now, the place to live is here, and the way to be happy is to ensure others are happy."
